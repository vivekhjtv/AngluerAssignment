# Angular Project Assignment

## Overview

This project is an Angular 18 application that demonstrates client-side navigation, data fetching from a public API, and the implementation of a reactive form. The application includes three main pages: Home, API Data, and Form Page. The project uses Angular services and HttpClient for API requests and demonstrates form validation using reactive forms.

## Requirements

### Set Up the Angular Project

- Initialize a new Angular 18 project using Angular CLI.
- Set up routing for client-side navigation.

### Create Client-Side Navigation

- Implement a navigation bar with links to at least three pages: Home, API Data, and a Form Page.
- Use Angular Router to handle navigation.

### Create Pages

- **Home Page**: A simple landing page with introductory text.
- **API Data Page**: A page that consumes data from a public API and displays it.
- **Form Page**: A reactive form to submit contact information using the registration form.

### Use Angular Service and HTTP Client

- Create a service to handle API requests.
- Use Angularâ€™s HttpClient to fetch data from any public API.
- Implement methods in the service to retrieve data and handle responses.

### Implement Reactive Form

- Create a reactive form on the Form Page with at least 3 fields.
- Validate the form inputs (e.g., required fields, valid email format).
- Display validation errors and feedback to the user.

### Deploy the Application

- Build the Angular application using Angular CLI.
- Deploy the application to a public hosting platform such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
